This is my visualization of thinking outside the box and breaking the mold. The maze is built with walls that trap you or hold you back. But what if you don't have to walk through the maze? What if you can dive it? As you dive deep, the ripples will cause a lot of turbulences, but eventually, the walls will dissolve all around you.

This painting was displayed at the Duke student art show in 2024.
