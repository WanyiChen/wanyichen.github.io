In spring 2023, I photographed some wild orchids on a hike near Zebulon, North Carolina. These orchids were nicknamed "lady slipper" because of their unique shape. I thought that since they were called lady slippers, there must be a lady. So, I painted the lady on top of the photograph.

This painting was displayed at the Duke student art show in 2024.
