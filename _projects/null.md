This painting is inspired by my own Ph.D. thesis. I was investigating how machine learning researchers and engineers treat missing data. 
I commissioned myself to showcase my research with a painting, but the most challenging part was how I could paint missing data. 
How could I paint something that's missing?

Then, I realized that in other fields, people use visualizations to represent missingness all the time. At the top of the painting is a 
typical old TV screen when the signal is lost. It's a visual representation of missing signals. At the bottom of the painting is a 
checkboard pattern representing transparent layers in photo processing tools. It's a visual representation of missing pixels. Although 
missingness is a state of void, people have come up with a great variety of colorful and patterned visualizations of missingness. 
In machine learning, missing data in different datasets are often represented differently. Some are blanks, some are "NaN"s, and yet others
are filled with a pre-determined value such as 0 or 999.

Moreover, machine learning researchers and engineers often try to fill in missing values with guessed values, a process known as imputation. 
However, if not done carefully, imputation could introduce biases into the dataset and distort the results. The middle of the painting 
illustrates how a seemingly simple transformation step could lead to distortion. The signal-lost TV screen is transformed by Procreate's "Liquify - twirl right" 
function (with all parameters set to max) with one click.

In machine learning, it is important to investigate the patterns of missing data before deciding on how to treat missing data. Sometimes 
the patterns won't be apparent, so careful investigation is needed. Did you realize that this painting contains missing pixels? You can 
investigate it! Copy and paste this painting onto any non-white background, and you'll see a pattern emerge. For example, you can create a non-white
rectangle shape in PowerPoint and paste this picture on top of it.
